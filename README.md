# Sentiment-analysis-Ethereum-Price-Prediction-using-Reddit

Problem: To what extent can the sentiment analysis of Reddit threads and comments on Ethereum be used to determine its price? 

Approach: Collected threads and comments from the Reddit website. Cleaned and prepared data using NLP techniques. Performed sentiment analysis and built machine learning prediction model using sentiment scores and latent semantic analysis scores

Result: XGBoost model was the best-performing model at predicting price. Need future improvement to increase accuracy by combining with other models
